title: About frameworks

Recently I've been learning some frameworks, like vue, react, gatsby, etc. There are a lot! I think for one persion to get to know all
these frameworks, that might be impossible. I mean you might be familiar with some, and pretty good at a few, but you can't be an expert
in all frameworks. But there are some common concepts and inner rules.

So what is a framework. In my opinion, frameworks are some rules that some genenius defined that make you follow, so that you can finish
your work easily in some way. I mean you surely are not forced to use a framework, but if you use, it probably gives you some relife, but
in exchange of you following their rules.

I say this doesn't mean that I am good enough to not use a framework, I do use a framework in my project, and for now I don't have the
ability to create a framework, and get rid of other's frameworks. But I have to realize that frameworks might make us restrained to some
others, and feel more depended on others. But maybe that's a trend.

Above are some thoughts from personally, if you don't agree, that's totally ok.
