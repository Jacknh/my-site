title: Some confusions

Recently I've been thinking about to learn some server side coding stuff, specificly on nodejs. But I met a problem. Here it is.

I used pirple dotcom to study, originally I thought it is a brilliant website for nodejs learning, because it does everyting from scratch.
No libraries, no frameworks, no packages, everyting from zero. But gradually I found it's not that good. It gives you a good path to familiar
with the nodejs syntax itself, but it does not give you the whole picture of modern website building process. I mean there are no any websites
in the world now just using pure nodejs to build, that's just not possible! It is gonna meet tons of problems if do that way. That's a big 
question.

And also, the experience of that course is not very pleasant. The customer service is not that good there from my viewpoint. Anyways, that's
not the point I want to say. So how should I learn techs by myself in the future? Honestly I got a little confused. There should be something 
points that could be introduced in, and then after that, make the whole journey moving forward. But I just don't know yet.

I write this down to record my learning path, to make me be reminded and keep thinking. Sorry for no tech blogs came out yet. I promise it will
soon. If you get here, thank you!
